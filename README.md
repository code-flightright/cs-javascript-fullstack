# Javascript Fullstack Exercise

## The server side
Design and implement a backend service that `GET` data from [randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me/api/?results=300&nat=de,dk,fr,gb&inc=id,gender,name,location,email,dob,picture,nat&seed=flightright). Group the results by `nat` (nationality / country) and expose the new object as `/nat` endpoint so it can be used by a frontend application.
